                Hello, my name is Claudio, I am from Venezuela, I moved to the US back in 2016 when I was 19 years old, in my country I studied Oil Engineering which was an amazing career. However, I decided to do a career change and my goal is to become a programmer, it is one of my goals which I am trying to reach at this time.

            <p>
                I have worked in different projects through my entire life, from small to medium size ones. Started changing the source code of websites to computer games, playing with code is one of the things that make my days interesting and no repetitive.
